Sustaining Our Planet for Future Generations
There is concern worldwide that environmental issues we face today will have an impact on future generations. Your challenge is to create a way to communicate the importance of environmental responsibility to people of all ages.
GreenX
Summary
Our team OrionVI is developing an app named GreenX which is highly motivated to create social awareness against deforestation &amp; climate change. Here users will plant a single plant to start their journey. They can chat, notice weather data, share progress on social media, watch photos and activities. We are using Nasa data for visualizing Nasa Corner and giving predictions. Our robot GreenSoccer can work in the field, helping farmers, nursing plants, analyzing real-time data. We believe that our motto “Plant Green, Sustain Future” will create a great impact to save the environment, to save the world.
How We Addressed This Challenge
 Our project meets the Challenge sustain through our developed project GreenX and GreenSoccer. GreenX is a user-friendly mobile application that enables people to interact with the environment and also create awareness in the world about the importance of tree plantations. In this app, a user has to plant a tree or shrub. After capturing a picture of his plant he has to upload the picture to our app or put a link to shared posts on social media. After analyzing the image App gives the user credit that helps him to level up. In this way, if we have 1 million users at the end of the year we have nearly 1 billion trees. Which almost 30 percent of the world’s deforestation rate. Besides observing real-time weather data, one can also compare environmental data from different years and plot them on a graph by using NASA’s past weather reports. Options like Astronomy Image of the Day, NASA Corner that contains various illustrations of NASA’s images, data, kids friendly website link, will encourage a user to know about earth and space. Users also can share their rank on social media and chat with others through this app. The other attraction of this app is Greensoccer, which allows people to get access to real-time data of their fields, especially farmers. In the farmer corner, the farmer can chat and call with the specialist. Also, the GreenSoccer nurses plants by observing temperature, soil moisture, pesticide control. At the end of the day best user nominated as a “changemaker of the day” award. This is a simple game for the users but a big step for the world. So, the project is so important for saving our generations from the upcoming dangers.

How We Developed This Project
The ever-engaging destruction of our planet inspired us to take this challenge. We just thought about what needed to be done and we did accordingly. We used Kivy to develop our app which is an open-source Python library used for creating cross-platform applications. For faster development, we’ve also used KivyMD which consists of some Kivy widgets created following Google’s material design guideline. We thought it'll be easy to go with Python. But later, we found that it would be more efficient if we’ve used native solutions like building apps with Java, Kotlin, or Dart (Flutter). We also had issues finding the right API for our project. We’ve used Code OSS as our code editor.

And we have a Robot for field level activities named GreenSoccer. GreenSoccer is an autonomous robot which can water plants, distribute pesticide to plants, and can show real-time data like Temperature, Humidity, Air pressure, Methane gas in ppm. Moreover, it can make people aware of environmental protection like planting trees, stopping carbon emission, etc. Our robot mainly can be used for caring plants and trees in busy urban cities.

For the coding part of the robot, we’ve used C++, Python, and Arduino. We’ve developed the robot with- 

Arduino Mega, Arduino Nano, 4 Motors, 4 Wheels, Soil Moisture Sensor, BMP280, LCD display, Input Panel, IR sensor, Color sensor, Water Pump, Water Reservoir, Gas Sensor, Speaker, Micro Sd card Module, Lipo Battery, Relay Module, Water Sensor, LDR etc electronic components. Moreover, we’ve used HC-05 and ESP8266 Wifi Module for Data Sharing. In the future, we want to add Raspberry Pi and RPI CAM for processing the image of plants and detect whether it is infected with diseases or not. Also, we are customizing our robot so that it is fully capable of real-life implementation.

How We Used Space Agency Data in This Project
To get weather data from previous years, we’ve used the NASA Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources website. We’ve used its API to get daily and annual data of temperature, moisture, and wind. We’ve also used the Astronomy Picture of the Day website for its APOD API. We’ve also added some useful links in our apps like Nasa Climate Kids, Space Place (English), Earth Observatory Kids, NASA Image Gallery, and Nasa Climate.
